This study presents a variation of the dictator game experiment where participants were asked to share the collective rewards with their team members after performing a team-based task. Participants consisted of 341 males of either Black or White races from the United States. The experiment manipulated the racial composition of the teams, where participants were assigned to teams with two more members of either the same or different race as them. Participants could only see the virtual avatars of themselves and their team members, which had different skin colors based on race. After performing the task, participants were given the collective rewards for their teams and were asked to keep some mount of that for themselves and equally distribute the rest to their team members. Finally, questions on their normative and empirical expectations for this behavior were also asked to understand the motivations of their actions. Results showed no significant difference between peer evaluation scores and generosity of earnings for various racial compositions of teams. Implications of these results are discussed. Some additional analyses on the effect of other factors on the peer evaluation scores and generosity of earnings as well as the relationship between generosity and normative expectations have been discussed in the Appendix.
